# uweb

Uweb is a web-based way to interface with devices running micropython. It provides 
both file-editing capabilites (provided by the excellent codemirror project) and
a (jupyter-notebook-like) alternative to the bare webrepl.

Uweb uses the standard micropython webrepl and its file-transfer protocols. No 
additional things are needed on the micropython board.
